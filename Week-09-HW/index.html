  <p class="body"> I just took time from working on this to watch the "Thor: Ragnarok" Trailer. So here are the lyrics to "Immigrant Song" by Hollywood Undead:</p>
  <p>Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde, singing and crying,
Valhalla, I am coming!
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow</p>

<p>How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing</p>

<p>If you haven't already watched the trailer...Concider doing it, it looks pretty good. Side note: It was directed by my favorite director-Taika Waititi. I am so excited...I haven't seen a Marvel movie in theatres since the first <i>Captain America</i>...and I haven't watched on in general since <i>Gaurdians of the galaxy</i>
Jeff Goldblum is in it.</p>
