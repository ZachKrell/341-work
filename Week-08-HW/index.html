    <p class="part1-story"> There is this man who lives out in the mountains named Alexander...Do not, I repeat, do not call him Alex.
    A big, burly man and looks like he could tear you apart if he wanted too.
    </p>
    <p> Alexander would never do that thought, he loved all creatures. Alexander was a good man, and he led a simple life. he hunted for his own food, 
    built his own shelter, and lived completely off the grid. Alexander was happy.
    </p>
    <p>It was about a year ago that I met Alexander, I was hiking in the wood and found his cabin. I thought that I was pretty far away form any civilization...Who's cabin was this?
    Naturally invasive as I am I knocked on the door, and out popped this giant of a man yelling "Yes! Who are you!?" As he was holding a knife covered in blood.
    </p>
    
    <p>Of course I was taken back and thought I was about to die. I suppose that a natural reaction would have been to run, 
    but something about him made me stay. I assume it was because he was wearing an apron that had garfield saying "I Hate Mondays." on it. 
    Alexander immediately realize how terrifying he must have looked, and put the knife down and stepped outside.
    </p>
    <p>In a voice that was still way to loud Alexander expressed regret and asked what i was doing there. I explained to him that I just stummbled upon his cabin
    and was curious about it. Alexander, the ever gracious host, offered to let me stick around and eat some of the meat he was preparing. I agreed curious to learn more about this strange man.
    </p>
    <p>Sitting around a fire that he stared impossibly fast, he told me why he was in the mountains.
    He explained, still obnoxiously loud, "Yeah, one day I was on hod with the cable company and I just lost it...I couldn't deal with society anymore! So I left and came out here! 
    I love it! I just couldn't deal with the rat race anymore!" I asked, "what do you do for fun?" "I race rats!" he said as he stood up and gestured for me to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>He showed me to the back of his cabin where he had a whole race track set up for these rats that had numbers painted on their sides. He rang a bell and sure enough the rats began racing. As other woodland creatures came to watch as if
    it was their Super Bowl. "Best decision I ever made!" Alexander smiled.
    </p>
    <h3 class="The-city">The City</h3>
    <p>After Talking to Alexander I wanted to learn more about his life. I begged him to come back to the city with me and show me his old life. He finally agreed, and the next morning we wer on our way.
    </p>
    <p>Our first stop was Alexander's old workplace. It turns out he used to be an accountant. We went into the building and saw his old boss. Alexander wanted to apologize for just leaving. "It was something I always felt bad about!" He said.
    When he walked into his bosses office, the boss simply said, "Alex! Are you done with the Tredwell accounts?" Not even realizing that he has been gone for years. 
    "Not yet sir!" Alexander said timidly. The boss shooed us out to get back to work, after all time is money.
    </p>
    <p> The Next stop on our tour was his old home...This is about the point that I learned that Alexander had a wife and two kids he left. As we got to the door we heard a woman yell, "You son of a Bitch!" And came running at us, as Alexander hid behind me.
    After yelling at us for another thirty minutes or so she finally asked, "Where the hell have you been!?" 
    Alexander proceded to tell her about the cable company and how he moved to the woods, and raced rats...he discussed the rats for a long time talking about each rat's specialty.
    </p>
    <p> "Why the hell didn't you tell me!? I would have gone with you! I hate it here!" she said.
    </p>
    <h3 class="back to the woods"> Back To The Woods</h3>
    <p> About a year has passed since Alexander and his wife went back to the woods, so I decided to go visit them.
    I received the same greeting as he first time, bloody knife and yelling. More people have joined their society. They tell me that more people wanted to join them and live off the grid.
    That everyone love the rat races. and that they have a pretty functional, but loose government and Alexander is king.
    </p>
