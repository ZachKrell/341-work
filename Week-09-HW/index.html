  I just took time from working on this to watch the "Thor: Ragnarok" Trailer. So here are the lyrics to "Immigrant Song" by Led Zeppelin:</p>
    
  <p>Ah, ah.</br>

We come from the land of the ice and snow,</br>
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow.</br>

Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new land.</br>
To fight the hordes and sing, and cry.</br>
Valhalla, I am coming.</br>

Always sweep with, with threshing oar.</br>
Our only goal will be the western shore.</br>

Ah, ah.</br>

We come from the land of the ice and snow,</br>
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow.</br>

How soft your fields so green. Can whisper tales of gore.</br>
Of how we calmed the tides of war. We are your overlords.</br>

Always sweep with threshing oar,</br>
Our only goal will be the western shore.</br>

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins.</br>
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing.</br>

Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh</br>
Ooh. Ah.</br>
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.</br>
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.</br></p>



<p>If you haven't already watched the trailer...Consider doing it, it looks pretty good. Side note: It was directed by my favorite director-Taika Waititi. I am so excited...I haven't seen a Marvel movie in theatres since the first <i>Captain America</i>...and I haven't watched on in general since <i>Gaurdians of the galaxy</i>
Jeff Goldblum is in it.</p>
