# Paralax Issues
This week I had one major problem. It wasn't he average problem that I have had, the one where I just don't know what I'm doing. It was a doozy, and a little embarrassing. I was in the library working on this assignment, feeling good that I was seemingly doing so well. I understood the code, and what I was doing. I knew it wasn't perfect, but I was doing my best. Then I went to launch th site...and nothing happend, the HTML came up, but nothing else. I started working on it, thinking that I would be a simple fix...but still nothing. It was about an hour and I was so frustrated. I took a break, and eventually went back to it and right when I wanted to give up entirely. I found the issue...I didn't do a </body> or </html>. So, as soon as I saw that the website worked. again, its still not perfect but I think its what you want.
