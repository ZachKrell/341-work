##Week three
  
###Duckett Book
  * I got the book, looked through it. It seems very helpful and is super cool.
 
###Atom
   * I'm still using Atom. It works like a dream.
   
###Html
   * I have little experience with Html, but it seems pretty easy. 
      I mean as long as you know the tags.
      
###Trials and Triumphs
   * Comparatively to last week this assignment was easier on me. 
   * Like I said, I have a little Html experience which made it easier.
   * I am more excited about going forward and less scared of this class!
   * Yay!!!!
   
##The poem
  * I took a poem from a former US Poet Laureate Robert Pinskey
  * This is the [cite I got it from](http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/poetry/antholog/pinsky/threepoems.htm)
