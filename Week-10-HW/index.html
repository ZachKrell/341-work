      <h1>Responsive Web Design and you</h1>
      <p>Responsive web design menas approching wed design so that the site can respond to the platform it is being shown on.
      The idea that the website will look relativly the same if you are looking at it on a computer screen, tablet, or smart phone.
      It uses flexible grids and and layouts to ensure that the website will be functional on any device.</p>

      <H2> I wanted to play with vertical boxes here</h2>
      <p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
      Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
      The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
      Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,<br>
      And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep<br>
      No more; and by a sleep, to say we end<br>
      the heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks<br>
      that Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation<br>
      devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,<br>
      To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,<br>
      for in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,<br>
      when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
      must give us pause. There's the respect<br>
      that makes Calamity of so long life:<br>
      For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,<br>
      the Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely,...<br>

      <H1> Why Should Developers Use RWD?</H1>
      <p> Why shouldn't they, In our modern times many people use their phones to look at sites. Why, I myself use my phone almost more, if not more, than I use my Laptop.
      I mean, its smaller, more light, and of course it is almost always conected to some form of wireless coverage. So, having a site that works, looks good, and functions properly on all devices is not only helpful...It is a necessity.</p>

    <div class="End-box">
      <H1>How RWD is achieved</H1>
      <p>RWD is achieved in a few ways. By using a flexbox layout the boxes are able to fit in differing size containers. Using Wireframes you can controll what you want your layout for people to see no matter what platform they are on.
       Using these CSS tools you should be able to create a nice, Functioning website that is all platform inclusive.</p>
