## Fifth Week Of Class

###Questionnaire

I had a hard tie thinking of something to ask you all about. I eventually landed on sports. Now I'm not really a sports guy, I just thought I would be an easy questionnaire to write
  * everyone knows about sports, so even if you sdon't like them you know of them.
  * I kinda like hockey, I'm no sports guy, but you know.
  * maybe It was a weird choice...I needed something though.

I had issues with the Images in the website because I was saving them as .jpg-s so It wasn't working.
As soon as I changed them to .Png-s everything was good. I had a harder time with this assignment than I have with the last two, but I think I hve got it. We'll see, as alway I'll just wait until the instructor tells me I did something wrong...which I always very likely.

I sure hope you enjoy this questionnaire
