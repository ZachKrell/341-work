## Week 08

   CSS has been interesting so far. I think I have a slight handle on it. I probably don't
 I had many problems but it was all trial and error...a lot of error.

  ### Issues
   *The main issue I had was with remembering all the parts that were needed for the Style sheet to work properly.
    
   *I also had issues with the color hex numbers...the problem was I didn't know how they worked exactly. I still don't.
    
   *At one point I had two really ugly colors that did not go together, and when I changed them the Web page its self wouldn't change. It took a few extra pushes for it to work properly. I had an issue with my title too...but that was only because I was being stupid.

   ### What I Learned
    
   *I learned that I need to pay a lot of attention when I am going throught the class tutorial, or I'm going to have a bad time. I should have known that and I normally do pay attention...but not this time I guess.
    
  *I learned that with CSS everything needs to be perfect, I left out a single semicolon and it wouldn't work...so that was fun. I just need to make sure my code is perfect.

   ## Going Further
    
 Going further I need to make sure I know whats going on, and I need to pay attention to my code. If I do those two things I should be good...Also, I apologize for the colors in my HTML, It might not be pretty I was going for a forest look but it didn't really work to well.
