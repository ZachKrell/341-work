##### This Week In Class
  * I went through the moduals, And learned more tags for HTML
  * I read parts of the Duckett book, it is such an easy read.
  * I used atom to create my index file.
  * I was really proud of this weeks work, it all made sense to me. I was really happy to know that, not only, that I understood what we       were learning this week, but that I seemed to be doing things right.I literally typed in "Recipes" into google and took the fourth one     I found. Lemon Meringue Pie...I had a fun time looking for chances to use the strike through tag or the insert delete tags...I think       my use of them were pretty good...and super natural too.

##### Wayback Machine

 Do you remember "Ask Jeeves" when I was younger...like 10...this was my go to site for asking questions. I just really like the I dea of the Jeeves guy "looking" for me...In hindsight the search engine sucked compared to google (google is the best(they might be listening)) I just wanted to take you way back and think of the butler we all forgot about.

I wanted to look at the worlds favorite research site...Wikipedia...The savior of procrastinators This site has been around since 2001 and has gone through many changes

The wayback machine isn't loading any photos, there were not many at this early point of Wikipedias life...but it did have a old version of the well know Logo

As you can see, it has come a long way...I assume through donations because they are alays askings...but it looks more user friendly now and is probably more interactive too.

This is it now...look how smooth it looks...beautiful.

I hope for my skills to evolve like these websites.
