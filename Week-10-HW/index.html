      <h1>Responsive Web Design and you</h1>
      <p>Responsive web design means approching web design in sucha a way that the site can respond to the platform it is being shown on.
      The idea that the website will look relativly the same if you are looking at it on a computer screen, tablet, or smart phone.
      It uses flexible grids and and layouts to ensure that the website will be functional on any device.</p>

      <H1> Why Should Developers Use RWD?</H1>
      <p> Why shouldn't they, In our modern times many people use their phones to look at sites. Why, I myself use my phone almost more, if not more, than I use my Laptop.
      I mean, its smaller, more light, and of course it is almost always conected to some form of wireless coverage. So, having a site that works, looks good, and functions properly on all devices is not only helpful...It is a necessity.</p>

      <H1>How RWD is achieved</H1>
      <p>RWD is achieved in a few ways. By using a flexbox layout the boxes are able to fit in differing size containers. Using Wireframes you can controll what you want your layout for people to see no matter what platform they are on.
       Using these CSS tools you should be able to create a nice, Functioning website that is all platform inclusive.</p>
