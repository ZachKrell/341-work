# Week-09-HW

## OH boy
  * I had a really difficult time this week. I could not for the life of me make my CSS work.
  * It wasn't until Nick helped me out that I realized that I was doing to much and making it to hard.
  * It turns out I wasn't nesting things properly, and what not.
  * So we got it figuered out, thank god.

### What I Learned
---
I learned that I need to pay attention to where I am nesting things, and make sure that I'm not going to overboard and making it to hard for myself. The colors worked better for me this time I decided to go with easier colors that work a little better togethr than last time, and I didn't forget to do semi-colons. I still feel like my computer doesn't push my changes properly. Like, I commit my changes and the site doesn't change for a few pushes still.

I just need to focus and start working on the projects earlier in the week.
