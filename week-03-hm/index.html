      <h2>Robert Pinsky</h2>
      <p>What is this body as I fall asleep again?<br>
What I pretended it was when I was small --<br>
<br>
A crowded vessel, a starship or submarine<br>
Dark in its dark element, a breathing hull,<br>
<br>
Arms at the flanks, the engine heart and brain<br>
Pulsing, feet pointed like a diver's, the whole<br>
<br>
Resolutely diving through the oblivion<br>
Of night with living cargo. O carrier shell<br>
<br>
That keeps your trusting passengers from All:<br>
Some twenty thousand times now you have gone<br>
<br>
Out into blackness tireless as a seal,<br>
Blind always as a log, but plunging on<br>
<br>
Across the reefs of coral that scrape the keel --<br>
O veteran immersed from toe to crown,<br>
<br>
Buoy the population of the soul<br>
Toward their destination before they drown.<br>
