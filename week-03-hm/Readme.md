    ##Week 3

    1. Duckett Book
      *I bought that Book, I really love it, it has been very infomative
        And its just a really cool book

    2. Atom
      * I'm still using Atom, it has been really easy to work with.
        I've been learning more and more about it

    3. Html
      * I have little experiacne with Html, but it seems like as long
        as you know the tags you should have a pretty easy time.

        4. I took a poem from a former poet laureate Robert Pinsky
          * [The website it got it from] (http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/poetry/antholog/pinsky/threepoems.htm)
