  <p class="body"> I just took time from working on this to watch the "Thor: Ragnarok" Trailer. So here are the lyrics to "Immigrant Song" by Hollywood Undead:</p>
    <p>Ah, ah,<br/>
We come from the land of the ice and snow,<br/>
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow<br/>
The hammer of the gods<br/>
Will drive our ships to new lands,<br/>
To fight the horde, singing and crying,<br/>
Valhalla, I am coming!<br/>
On we sweep with threshing oar,<br/>
Our only goal will be the western shore<br/>
Ah, ah,<br/>
We come from the land of the ice and snow,<br/>
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow</p>

<p>How soft your fields so green,<br/>
Can whisper tales of gore,<br/>
Of how we calmed the tides of war<br/>
We are your overlords<br/>
On we sweep with threshing oar,<br/>
Our only goal will be the western shore<br/>
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,<br/>
For peace and trust can win the day<br/>
Despite of all your losing</p>

<p>If you haven't already watched the trailer...Consider doing it, it looks pretty good. Side note: It was directed by my favorite director-Taika Waititi. I am so excited...I haven't seen a Marvel movie in theatres since the first <i>Captain America</i>...and I haven't watched on in general since <i>Gaurdians of the galaxy</i>
Jeff Goldblum is in it.</p>
